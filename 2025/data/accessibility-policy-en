<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>

<p>At RubyKaigi, we want you to be happy. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>As such, organizers are dedicated to providing conference experiences and environments that are equally welcoming, inviting, and accessible for all attendees. Some steps to ensure this are built into the program and physical design of the conference.</p>

<p>However, the organizers also recognize that accessibility issues are diverse. If you have any other accessibility requirements, or if you have any other feedback or questions, then please don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:2025@rubykaigi.org">get in touch with us</a>. While we cannot promise to accommodate each individual situation, we are committed to listening to every concern and request with an open ear.</p>
