  title: Make Parsers Compatible Using Automata Learning
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    CRuby currently has two parsers, Prism and parse.y, and starting with Ruby 3.4, Prism has become the default parser. Prism is a new Ruby parser that claims to be highly compatible with the traditional parser, parse.y. But, **how can we guarantee this compatibility**?
    One formal (academic) solution to this problem is **automata learning**, an algorithm to infer an automata from a black-box system. Automata has some benefits, e.g., we can verify two automata are the same. Therefore, we can ensure that Prism and parse.y are the same if their automata obtained by automata learning are the same.
    In this talk, we provide an overview the automata theory and introduce an algorithm of automata learning called L\*. We will also introduce the case study of **how a compatibility issue in Prism was found using automata learning** ([ruby/prism#3035](https://github.com/ruby/prism/issues/3035)). We believe it will be an interesting talk as an application of the latest academic topics.

  title: Introducing Type Guard to Steep
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Type checking in Ruby often requires narrowing the types of objects, especially within complex conditionals or method chains. While Steep already supports type narrowing through built-in methods like #is_a? and #nil?, real-world Ruby applications frequently rely on user-defined logic for type narrowing.

    In this talk, I will propose "Type Guard," an enhancement to Steep that enables developers to define custom type narrowing logic. This feature aims to bridge the gap between Steep's capabilities and the diverse needs of real-world Ruby projects, providing a more seamless type-checking experience.

    Attendees will learn how Type Guard works, and how it can be integrated into their projects.

    The CRuby build system based on GNU Autotools has been evolving over the years, and it has been a critical part of the Ruby development process. However, the current build system has two major challenges; 1. it's showing its age, and it's getting harder to edit and maintain without help from *the* expert person. 2. `./configure && make` takes a long time even on a modern machine with many cores.

    In this talk, I will discuss the evolution of the CRuby build system, the challenges we face today, and the potential future directions. I will also introduce the new build system that I have been working on, which is inspired by the Shake build system.

    I talked about ["Goodbye fat gem"](https://rubykaigi.org/2020/presentations/ktou.html) at RubyKaigi Takeout 2020. Fat gem is a gem that includes pre-built binaries. Extension libraries can assume that users have build environment with Ruby 2.4 or later. So gems don't need to bundle pre-built binaries for easy to install. Users can build binaries by themselves.

    As of 2025, we're still using fat gem...

    Most existing Ruby stack profilers rely on the GVL, which blocks application execution and leads to high CPU usage.

    SDB, on the other hand, releases the GVL when scanning Ruby thread stacks. This design minimizes its impact on Ruby applications, allowing us to increase the sampling rate from 100/s to 1000/s while still consuming very low CPU. This makes SDB a truly always-online stack profiler.

    In this talk, I will explain how to implement a stack profiler without relying on the GVL, along with its benefits and challenges.

  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    One of Ruby’s most powerful features is the ability to extend the language itself through meta-programming. We can create rich and elegant DSLs that allow developers to solve problems with flexible and concise code.

    The drawback of DSLs is that they are difficult to analyze statically, reducing the usefulness of developer tooling like editor integrations. Since each gem can define their own DSL, we cannot account for all possible DSLs that may exist in a given application. So what can we do?

    Let’s do a deep dive into the Ruby LSP’s add-on API, which allows any other gem to enhance the static analysis understanding of the language server for a more accurate editor experience. We’ll explore the techniques behind it and which class of problems it can solve.

  title: Parsing and generating SQLite's SQL dialect with Ruby
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: SQLite's popularity is on the rise, and likewise the ecosystem of tools
    around it is growing. Unfortunately, SQLite does not expose its parser for 3rd
    parties to use independently. This greatly limits the ability of developers to
    build tools that must interact with SQLite's SQL dialect. And so, I have hand-written
    a 100% Ruby, 100% compatible parser for SQLite's SQL dialect. In addition, having
    a complete AST permits us to also generate SQL queries from terse, structured
    Ruby code. In this talk, I will demonstrate how we ensure that the parser is 100%
    compatible with SQLite's SQL dialect. We will also explore how the parser is implemented
    and what kind of AST it produces. Then, we will dive into how to use the parser
    to build tools that can analyze and manipulate SQL queries. Finally, we will look
    at how to use the generator to build tools that can generate SQL queries programmatically.
    As Ruby's only full SQLite SQL parser, this library opens up a world of possibilities

    Performance bugs are really annoying. Our tests are still passing! It works on our machine and in staging! It even works for most customers in production!
    And then someone reports the app hangs, and there's timeouts...

    How would we know something's not correct? This is where observability tools come in: tools for monitoring, performance and debugging.
    But have you ever wondered how they work? These tools often require access to Ruby internals that regular Ruby libraries or applications don't have (or need).

    To support these use-cases, the CRuby VM has a number of low-level APIs that can be used to know more about such things as the state of threads, the global VM lock, object creation, garbage collection, etc.

    In this talk, I'll explore Ruby VM's low-level observability APIs: what they provide, how they can be used, lessons learned from using them, and how you can get started in building your own custom tools for performance bug investigations.

    What is a groovebox? It's a machine for sketching musical ideas, equipped with tools like synthesizers, step sequencers, filters, samplers, and interactive controls such as buttons, knobs, and displays.

    With groovebox-ruby, I began by implementing synthesizer basics like VCOs (Voltage Controlled Oscillators) and VCFs (Voltage Controlled Filters) to understand how these components shape sound. I then added a step sequencer, allowing users to program patterns and interact dynamically with MIDI inputs.

    Reimplementing these features in Ruby deepened my understanding of synthesizers, particularly the roles of oscillators and filters. Ruby's extensibility also enabled modular design, such as chaining filters, using MIDI controllers, and building a distributed step sequencer with dRuby.

    PicoRuby's VM is mruby/c.
    While it has the advantage of being memory-saving, it also has disadvantages such as a lack of Ruby language specifications and the inability to call Ruby methods from C.

    By integrating the mruby VM into PicoRuby's features of memory-saving runtime compilation and a practical development ecosystem, MicroRuby brings ISO/IEC 30170-compliant Ruby to microcontroller programming and expands the scope of application development.
    In this session, I will provide a detailed explanation of the technical barriers that this project has overcome.

    RuboCop has long faced issues with a lack of modularity and is now encountering new challenges due to changes in the parser engine.

    There has been extensive development of custom cop extension gems, but these extension methods have relied on RuboCop's implementation for a long time. RuboCop is widely used behind the scenes in the Ruby ecosystem. For example, the backends of Ruby LSP and Standard Ruby utilize RuboCop's engine. However, the division of responsibilities with these tools has been insufficient. The introduction of the plugin system using lint_roller and the Ruby LSP add-on aim to resolve these issues. I will discuss the adoption and availability of integrating these into RuboCop.

    Another major issue is the maintenance status of the Parser gem, which has long been RuboCop's backend parser. I will talk about RuboCop's future backend strategy based on Prism.

    You will gain insights into new methods of extending RuboCop and the upcoming changes in the near future.

  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    I introduced Happy Eyeballs Version 2 (RFC8305) (hereafter HEv2) into the socket library's `Socket.tcp` and `TCPSocket.new`.
    This algorithm addresses the issue of delays that occur when DNS resolution for one address family takes too long, or when one of the candidate IP addresses is unavailable, preventing fallback to other options.

    At RubyKaigi 2024, I presented how HEv2 was implemented in `Socket.tcp` (written in Ruby). And I initially planned to apply the same approach to `TCPSocket.new` (written in C). However, things did not go as expected, and the work began with reimplementing `Socket.tcp` itself.

    This was a deeply rewarding project—so much so that it turned me, a Rubyist with an interest in networking, into a Ruby committer.

    In this presentation, I will revisit HEv2, particularly focusing on `TCPSocket.new`, and share the journey of how it was implemented, merged, and eventually released as part of Ruby 3.4.

    This time I want to present the details of the optimizations and the various features for performance tuning. Meaningful optimization requires measurement and evaluation, so I have implemented features to record where and why various events such as JIT compilation, JIT code invalidation, and deoptimization (back to the interpreter) occurred, and to display the generated assembly for each virtual machine instruction. The actual optimizations implemented in *monoruby* include machine code inlining, method inlining, polymorphic method call optimization, faster instance variable access, faster array access, etc.

    to include YAML, etc., in the binary and also be able to read it via `IO.read`,

  title: Toward Ractor local GC
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Garbage collection (GC) is a big challenge in multi-Ractor systems. In the current implementation, all Ractors share a global heap, and GC requires stopping all Ractors to perform GC. This approach negatively impacts object allocation and GC performance.

    Ideally, GC should be executed in parallel for each Ractor's local heap. However, shareable objects make it difficult to track references and implement fully parallel GC.

    To address this, we propose Ractor-local GC, which focuses on collecting non-shareable, Ractor-local objects in parallel, while continuing to perform global GC for shareable objects by pausing all Ractors, as in the current system. This hybrid approach allows most GC operations to run in parallel, improving overall performance. Furthermore, since shareable objects are expected to be relatively few compared to non-shareable objects, the frequency of global GC should remain low.

    This talk will present the design of Ractor-local GC and the progress of its implementation.
