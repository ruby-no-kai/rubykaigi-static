  description: |-
    WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary format for programs written in any language, designed to eventually run everywhere without changes, mainly inside Web browsers. Wasm is now used beyond the Web, from edge computing to smart contracts in blockchain.

    Now CRuby can be compiled to WebAssembly, which can be run in web browsers and many non-web environments with WASI.

    This talk will give you how we got there, techniques, and its use cases.

  title: Making *MaNy* threads on Ruby
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    We will introduce *MaNy* project: supports massive number of threads on Ruby.

    Concurrent mchanism (threads, processes, etc.) is an important language feature especially for multiple network connections.
    Ruby supports Ractor/Thread/Fiber for concurrency. However making many Threads (and Ractors) introduce huge overhead. Fiber scheduler was introduced for this purpose but it has some limitations.

    On the other languages, for example, Go language supports goroutine. They can make many goroutines and they can run concurrently or in parallel. Other languages (Erlang, Rust, ...) also support similar features.

    They use a well-known technique called M:N threading. In short, M:N threading supports many N threads on M (enough small number) system threads. *MaNy* project introduces M:N threading into Ruby.

    In this talk, we will show the background and progress of *MaNy* project. Because we are replacing the threading mechanism of current Ruby, we can share some details about it.

  title: Building a Lightweight IR and Backend for YJIT
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Last year, the YJIT compiler was upstreamed into CRuby and released as part of Ruby 3.1. Key advantages of YJIT are that it delivers fast warm up time and significant speedup on typical Ruby workloads such as Rails applications. However, up to this point, YJIT has only been available on x86-64 platforms.

    This year, our goal is to transition from an experimental compiler towards something more broadly usable and future-proof. In order to make YJIT available on more platforms, we are currently working on the implementation of a new Intermediate Representation (IR) and backend for the compiler. This will make it possible for YJIT to run natively on the Apple M1/M2, AWS Graviton processors and the Raspberry Pi.

    This talk will cover our objectives and constraints, the design of our new IR, the strategy we took to be able to support both x86-64 and ARM CPUs, the challenges we encountered, how we plan to optimize the quality of the generated machine code, and early performance results.

    ruby/debug is one of the very active projects, and many users use it. Also, there are some hidden valuable features to enhance your development experience. This talk dives into Chrome integration and History Viewer within them.

    Chrome integration:
    Debugging with Chrome DevTools is the one of popular ways, especially in JavaScript. The advantages of Chrome DevTools are easy setup and a rich user experience. You don't have to install any tools except for Chrome.

    History Viewer:
    What do you do when you want to step back to the specified line?
    History Viewer can help you in the situation. History Viewer, which extends stepping back, is the feature in VSCode extension for ruby/debug. You can go back to the location without thinking about how many times "step back" commands are needed.

    In this talk, I will introduce how to use them and how they work, such as how to communicate between ruby/debug and Chrome DevTools.

    Ruby's long history. One method may describe a set of arguments and the types
    one way, but another may tell them differently. Ruby 3 gained a highly requested

  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    An object cache is like magic: put an object into the box and it comes back later, exactly as it went in. The magic is seductive because it makes things so easy.

    It only takes a bit of thought, however, to see the dangers of this trick. Class names can change; a method can return a different result. Objects exist in a universe, and that universe is constantly evolving.

    Marshal, Ruby's default binary serialization library, does not handle changes like this gracefully. We discovered this recently when a code change collided with a cached class, leading to a fire in production.

    To avoid incidents like this, we switched the cache serializer in our core Rails monolith from Marshal to MessagePack, an alternative, generic binary serializer. MessagePack has a more compact format than Marshal, with stricter typing and less magic.

    In this talk, I'll crack open MessagePack to show how it works, how we migrated to it, and why you might want to do the same.

    $ ruby test.rb
    test.rb:1:in `<main>': undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)

    This feature goes further in Ruby 3.2: more error support other than `NameError`/`NoMethodError` and more fine-grained error spotting.
    We also redesigned its backend by introducing a new API, `Exception#detailed_message`, which allows us to enhance error messages with fewer incompatibilities. In fact, it allowed simple integration with other error message extensions such as did_you_mean and dead_end.

    For a happy programming experience, type support is a very effective approach.
    However, type information is still far from sufficient.

    RBS definition is labor intensive.
    I have worked on RBS definitions for several libraries and applications.
    From my experience, I have found that different libraries and applications have very different needs for RBS generation.

    Therefore, I am developing a code generation framework for RBS.
    By writing code generation scripts using this framework, you can automate RBS generation as much as possible in accordance with Ruby code updates.
    You can use the Rack architecture to combine your preferred features to meet a variety of needs.
    In addition, you can test your own extensions on the fly or publish them as extension gems.

    This talk will present the progress of the project, implementation details, as well as the usefulness of the Rack architecture in one-shot scripting.

  title: A Faster CRuby interpreter with dynamically specialized IR
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    A new CRuby internal representation (IR) dynamically specialized during execution will be presented.  The major specialization includes generation of

    * Hybrid stack-RTL instructions
    * Type specialized instructions using basic block versioning technique
    * Speculatively specialized instructions based on profile-based information

    Deoptimization technique of speculatively specialized instructions when the original assumptions become wrong will be also discussed.

    Using specialized IR can significantly speed up the interpretation and can permit generation of effective JIT code with static compilers like MIR or GCC.  The new IR can be also used to implement Ruby specific optimizations, e.g. inlining.

    Performance comparison of CRuby interpreter with the specialized IR, the current CRuby interpreter, YJIT, and MJIT will be given for some benchmarks.

  title: Why is building the Ruby environment hard?
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    The Rubyists are facing the build error with missing libraries like openssl, libyaml and libffi issues when they install the new versions every year. Other people are facing issues of nokogiri, rmagick and others when they develop Rails application.

    Why we got these issues everyday? I describe the build failure case and their solution from the ruby-build maintainer's point of view. Finally, I introduce the plan for the imcompatible changes about build process in Ruby 3.2 and Rust support of next version of RubyGems.

  title: Automatically Find Memory Leaks in Native Gems
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Ruby apps are known to leak memory which causes performance degradation. This eventually results in the system running out of memory and killing the Ruby process. Often, this is caused by a buggy native gem that forgot to clean up unused memory. It's time to fix this problem. Introducing ruby_memcheck, a gem that automatically finds memory leaks in native gems, powered by Valgrind Memcheck.

    In this talk, we'll discuss memory leaks, the Valgrind Memcheck tool, and how ruby_memcheck works.

  title: The Better RuboCop World to enjoy Ruby
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    Tools like RuboCop are very useful. I am very grateful for contributors.
    I think it's really helpful to keep our code clean and consistent.

    However, sometimes I feel there is a gap between 'Cop' culture and Ruby culture. In general, 'Cop' restricts our rights though Ruby gives freedom to us.

    I understand we have right not to use RuboCop or disable some Cops. But it is not very easy in reality, especially for Ruby beginners in their teams. To make them happier, experts would be able to set up config perfectly. But again, it is not very easy in reality. As a result, even though there is no evil, in some case people wrongfully make detour and give up their creativeness to keep CI green. It's a pity, isn't it?

    In this talk, I introduce my thoughts on RubyCop and programming and some idea of a bit better RuboCop world, with lower risk to damage productivity and to misguide beginners.

  title: Fast data processing with Ruby and Apache Arrow
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: |-
    I introduced Ruby and Apache Arrow integration including the "super fast large data interchange and processing" Apache Arrow feature at [RubyKaigi Takeout 2021](https://rubykaigi.org/2021-takeout/presentations/ktou.html).

    This talk introduces how we can use the "super fast large data interchange and processing" Apache Arrow feature in Ruby. Here are some use cases:

    * Fast data retrieval (fast `pluck`) from DB such as MySQL and PostgreSQL for batch processes in a Ruby on Rails application
    * Fast data interchange with JavaScript for dynamic visualization in a Ruby on Rails application
    * Fast OLAP with in-process DB such as DuckDB and Apache Arrow DataFusion in a Ruby on Rails application or irb session

  title: Fixing Assignment Evaluation Order
  type: presentation
  language: EN
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: For a long time, Ruby's assignment evaluation order was inconsistent.
    Normal assignment would evaluate the left hand side before the right hand side,
    but multiple assignment and constant assignment would evaluate the right hand
    side first.  This issue was known since before the release of Ruby 1.9.3, but
    it was considered difficult to fix. Come learn how we fixed evaluation order for
    multiple assignment in Ruby 3.1, and evaluation order for constant assignment
    in Ruby 3.2.

  title: String Meets Encoding
  type: presentation
  language: JA
  live_or_recorded: venue
  description: Ruby's String has Encoding, which allows for very flexible character
    encoding. What is the trade-off for that flexibility? I recently looked at the
    bottleneck in CSV.read and found that in one file with Encoding CP932, 30% of
    the processing time was spent on String#split. From the perspective of optimizing
    String#split, we will explain the relationship between String and Encoding in
    Ruby, how String knows its own Encoding, and which process is the bottleneck.
    Then we will discuss approaches toward faster encoding.

    I have been developing Steep, a static type checker for Ruby, for more than five years. Let's see how it transforms an editor into an IDE and how the Ruby programming experience changes with it.

    This session includes a live coding using Steep. It will start with writing the RBS type definitions, then demonstrate Ruby coding with IDE assistance, and finally refactor the code. This is how I write new Ruby code and will show the benefits of using Steep.

  description: |-
    I will talk about history of Japanese reference manual and future plans.
    Contributing to current Japanese Ruby reference manual (rurema) is harder than other projects.
    Because current document format (based on RD) is not familiar to recent Ruby users, and there are a few documents for new contributors.
    So I will explain historical reasons and how to improve systems for new contributors.

    YJIT is CRuby's second just-in-time compiler first released with Ruby 3.1.0.
    Much sweat and tears were shed during YJIT's development. What are the performance
    goals of YJIT and how are we going for them? How do CPUs react to YJIT's output?
    What is it like to retrofit a JIT compiler into a runtime system with a long history?
    Why is Rust involved now?
