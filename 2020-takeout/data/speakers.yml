      My work is onboard people in a large Ruby codebase, and most of the time, I'm showing code or hunting for some code examples.

      While developing some educational RuboCop cops, I found the RuboCop node pattern very useful to target code offenses. Then, I developed a similar tool to search and allow refactoring code based on node pattern concept.
